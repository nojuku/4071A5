Process for this one started with realizing that i've used the idea of hand/arm gestures previously, in particular when designing the noise wave and spatial clicks sounds. Therefore i decided to explore a wider domain - spatial localization. My interest was to be able to be in different parts of a room and hear different things. After studying the proposed ML technologies i decided to go with PoseNet and Wekinator for gesture recognition. After having some issues with PoseNet n4m installs i finally got it to work with an earlier version of Max :).. One of the problems that i have discovered was that it is a difficult task to cover my whole living room with a single camera due to limited angle of view as well as interior obstructions. The other was that i needed to be in the scene and record training data in Wekinator at the same time. After not finding an easy solution to both i arranged to meet my friend today at the ACW103 where there would be enough space and they would help me record some data. While awaiting our meeting i looked more into the mc stuff, where i left off before, and set up a simple mc resonators model based on Zicarelli's talk from Youtube. I was hoping to save several states of resonators/noise and change them by moving around the room. Additionally i aimed to perform my old gestures with the iPhone while moving. When we got to the lab and trained a model (discrete states with no interpolation) i realized that i am having problem with receiving my previous gestures from the iPhone. It seems that the ip/wifi situation at York is different and i was not able to connect my phone via the new ip.. The video documentation shows three resonator states based on three areas of the room. Two of them have high pitch / high attention sound while one in the middle is a soft drone. I found it pleasant to walk in and out of the soft drone, taking a break from the active far sides of the room. Additionally it was interesting to try and quickly pass the middle soft section so that the computer doesn't grasp the transition and jumps to the opposite side of the room right away. This is all still work in progress, but it was very exciting.
